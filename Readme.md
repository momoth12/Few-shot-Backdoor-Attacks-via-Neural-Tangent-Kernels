Here is our  study of the paper  few shot backdoor attacks via Neural tangent kernel from ICLR.
Here is a link where you can find it https://openreview.net/forum?id=a70lGJ-rwy

You can find the study on tradoff from backdoor attacks on CIFAR and MNIST datasets in the notebooks trade_off_cifar.ipynb and trade_off_mnist.ipynb.
You can also run our study of attacks with gaussian kernels.

You can also find the implementation of the paper methods in neural_tangent_kernel.ipynb.
But, keep ahead that it necessitate too many GPUs to run
